might need to set the JDK location

export JAVA_HOME=/home/tsmaster/Dropbox/Dev/CWG2024/CWG-LibKTX/OpenJDK/jdk-22.0.1

then use gradle

./gradlew lwgl3:run
./gradlew android
./gradlew html:superDev
  then open a browser to inspect
./gradlew :teavm:run

Open the project:
~/Dropbox/Dev/AndroidStudio/android-studio/bin/studio.sh [maybe Project?]

No, prefer IntelliJ Idea

Seems to be working on HTML/TeaVM
pushed up the teavm/build/dist/webapp folder to S3/bigdicegames.com/CWG2024
which means http://bigdicegames.com/CWG2024/index.html plays the "game"

Got a USB gamepad recognized on desktop, but it crashes web - maybe I
need to set up dependencies for the TeaVM project. For now, it's
guarded by a runtime test.

next up:
continue rewriting Ashley-ECS code to Fleks-ECS code

Rewriting Ashley ECS code to Fleks ECS code

So far, pretty easy - all(?) that remains is the projectile system.

next up:
finish Fleks port
remove Ashley code
remove Ashley dependencies
